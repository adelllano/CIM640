        <p>My name is <strong>Angie Del-Llano</strong> and I am currently a student at the University of Miami.  I'm in my first semester, studying Interactive Media at the School of Communication. In addition to being a student, I work for the university as a full-time employee. </p>
        <p>I am from Santa Cruz, Bolivia but I have lived in the United States since I was two years old. Like most people, I enjoy traveling, even if it's in Florida! Some of the cities in Florida I enjoy visiting regularly include: <a class= "class1" href="http://www.cityofkeywest-fl.gov/">Key West</a>, <a class= "class1" href="http://www.cityofmarcoisland.com/">Marco Island</a>, and <a class= "class1" href="http://www.visittampabay.com/">Tampa</a>.  </p>
        <p>When I'm not traveling, I enjoy being home with my dogs and taking them for long walks around the neighborhood. Some of my interests include: </p>
